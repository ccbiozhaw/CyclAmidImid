## Background

The historical development of various naming and classification schemes to describe enzymes with hydrolytic activity toward lactams and cyclic imides has contributed to a fragmented landscape that poses challenges in the search for novel biocatalysts, particularly for organic synthesis in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industry. To identify (novel) hydrolytic enzymes suitable for application, we thus suggest to not only rely on functional classifiers (such as EC numbers) but also use structural folds as a search criterium (CATH IDs). In this context, we have generated a data repository of promising hydrolase superfamilies to facilitate the identification of cyclic imide or lactam hydrolyzing enzymes.

## Databases

For each herein described structural fold, thousands of promising enzymes were assembled in a searchable database, linking their NCBI accessions, amino acid sequences and lengths, as well as their SeqID (experimentally) confirmed lactamases/imidases. To provide an additional filtering opportunity, we have added extremophilic annotations (thermophilic, psychrophilic, and halophilic), which can support mining for enzymes with improved process properties, such as thermal- or solvent stability.

Databases can be found as .m8 files (can be opened via Excel), Cytoscape Sessions, as well as in an interactive webapp:
